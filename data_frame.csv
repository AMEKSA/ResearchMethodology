"Tselentis, Dimitrios I.; Vlahogianni, Eleni I.; Yannis, George",Driving safety efficiency benchmarking using smartphone data,"This paper aims to provide a methodological framework for the comparative evaluation of driving safety efficiency based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The analysis considers each driver as a Decision Making Unit (DMU) and aims to provide a relative safety efficiency measure to compare different drivers based on their driving performance. The last is defined based on a set of driving analytics (e.g. distance travelled, speed, accelerations, braking, cornering and smartphone usage) collected using an innovative data collection scheme, which is based on the continuous recording of driving behavior analytics in real time, using smartphone device sensors. Safety efficiency is examined in terms of speed limit violation, driving distraction, aggressiveness and safety on urban, rural and highway road and in an overall model. DEA models are identifying the most efficient drivers that lie on the efficiency frontier and act as peers for the rest of the non-efficient drivers. The proposed methodological framework is tested on data from fifty-six (56) drivers during a 7-months period. Findings help distinguish the most efficient drivers from those that are less efficient. Moreover, the efficient level of inputs and outputs to switch from non-efficiency to the efficiency frontier is identified. Results also provide a potential for classification of the driving sample based on drivers' comparative safety efficiency. The main characteristics of the most and less efficient drivers are consequently analyzed and presented. Most common inefficient driving practices are identified (aggressive, risky driving, etc.) and driving behavior is comparatively evaluated and analyzed.",10.1016/j.trc.2019.11.006
"Yan, Ying; Dai, Youhua; Li, Xiaodong; Tang, Jinjun; Guo, Zhongyin",Driving risk assessment using driving behavior data under continuous tunnel environment,"Objective: Driving behavior is the key feature for determining the nature of traffic stream qualities and reflecting the risk of operating environments. However, evaluating the driving risk accurately and practically in continuous tunnels (tunnels with a space more than 250 m and less than 1000 m) still faces severe challenges due to the complex driving conditions. The objective of this study is to predict the driving risk indicators and determine different risk levels. Methods: The naturalistic driving system equipped with a road environment and driving behavior data acquisition system combined with the fixed-point test method was used for data collection in 130 tunnels on four highways. A traditional AASHTO braking model and convex hull algorithm were adopted to predict the critical safety speed and the critical time headway of each risk feature point in tunnels. According to the risk constraints under free-flow, car-following and lane-changing conditions, the average traffic flow risk index (TFRI) representing six risk levels and the safety threshold of the corresponding risk indicators were determined. Results: The findings of this study revealed that the critical safety speed at nighttime is slower than in other daytime conditions in continuous tunnels. The time headway slightly changes under 90 km/h. As the speed continues to increase, speed has a significant influence on the critical time headway. The only reliable interaction involved the different adverse weather conditions on the mean critical safety speed in the continuous tunnels (short plus long) (F = 9.730, p0.05) and single long tunnels (F = 12.365, p0.05). Conclusions: It can be concluded that driving behaviors significantly vary in different tunnel risk feature points and the combined effect of high speed and luminance variation may result in high driving risk. The performance validation indicted that the risk assessment level determined by the proposed approach is consistent with the real safety situations. The study provides an effective and generally acceptable method for identifying driving risk criteria that can also be applied for traffic management and safety countermeasures with a view to possible implementation in continuous tunnels.",10.1080/15389588.2019.1675154
"van Nes, Nicole; Bargman, Jonas; Christoph, Michiel; van Schagen, Ingrid",The potential of naturalistic driving for in-depth understanding of driver behavior: UDRIVE results and beyond,"Within the UDRIVE project, a rich cross-European naturalistic driving database was created which includes everyday driving data on car and truck drivers and powered two-wheeler riders. The database provides extensive, reliable insights into driving behavior in real traffic as a foundation for improving the safety and sustainability of European road traffic. This paper discusses the characteristics of the data in the UDRIVE database elucidating key methodological choices and presenting a selection of results to date. A priority of the study design was obtaining in-depth information on driving behavior, permitting the exploration of diverse research questions. A tailor-made data acquisition system collected very comprehensive data. A total of 287 drivers/riders participated. The sample size restricts the addressable research topics to common behaviors in everyday driving and limits the generalizability of results. However, the data are extensive and promising analyses have already been performed. The results show differences between European countries for distracting activities, seatbelt use, and looking behavior towards cyclists at urban intersections. Moreover, it shows that European drivers engage less in mobile phone use than U.S. drivers. It is likely that European drivers differ in other ways, also-highlighting the dataset's value for developing and implementing targeted safety measures, for the E.U. and its individual countries. Based on the comparison of the different studies, the paper introduces the general conceptual framework for naturalistic driving studies, providing insight in the relation between the scope of a naturalistic driving study and the key methodological choices on sample selection and data acquisition system.",10.1016/j.ssci.2018.12.029
"Warren, Josh; Lipkowitz, Jeff; Sokolov, Vadim",Clusters of Driving Behavior From Observational Smartphone Data,"Understanding driving behaviors is essential for improving safety and mobility of our transportation systems. Data is usually collected via simulator-based studies or naturalistic driving studies. Those techniques allow for understanding relations between demographics, road conditions and safety. On the other hand, they are very costly and time consuming. Thanks to the ubiquity of smartphones, we have an opportunity to substantially complement more traditional data collection techniques with data extracted from phone sensors, such as GPS, accelerometer gyroscope and camera. We developed statistical models that provided insight into driver behavior in the San Francisco metro area based on tens of thousands of driver logs. We used novel data sources to support our work. We used cell phone sensor data drawn from five hundred drivers in San Francisco to understand the speed of traffic across the city as well as the maneuvers of drivers in different areas. Specifically, we clustered drivers based on their driving behavior. We looked at driver norms by street and flagged driving behaviors that deviated from the norm.",10.1109/MITS.2019.2919516
"Ekman, Fredrick; Johansson, Mikael; Bligard, Lars-Ola; Karlsson, MariAnne; Stromberg, Helena",Exploring automated vehicle driving styles as a source of trust information,"Trust is important for users' acceptance and adoption of automated vehicles (AVs). Previous research has mainly focused on what information affects user trust in AVs and how the user's trust is affected by the way the content is communicated. However, recent studies have shown that trust may also be affected by the AV's driving style. The aim of the study was to further investigate if and how the vehicle's driving style affects user trust in AVs and, in particular, how this is expressed by users. An experiment involving 18 participants, using a Wizard of Oz setup and within a subject design, was conducted comparing two different driving styles, 'Defensive' and 'Aggressive'. Trust was measured using a mixed method research design including momentaneous trust ratings and think-aloud procedures while driving, a post-run trust questionnaire as well as trust curve sketching and a personal interview. The results show that driving style had an effect on user trust and that the 'Defensive' driving style was perceived as more trustworthy, in part because it was deemed more predictable than the 'Aggressive' driving style. Furthermore, participants expressed trust in using affective, analogical and analytic responses, the two former during the test runs and the latter directly after each test run. The interview after the completion produced a more mixed result. By combining different data collection methods, a nuanced picture of the trust formation process and users' trust in AVs was obtained. The study concludes that it is important to consider the vehicle performance information provided by the vehicle's driving style so as to create user trust in AVs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

"Adamos, Giannis; Nathanail, Eftihia",Testing the Effectiveness of Objective and Subjective Predictors of Driving Behavior under Fatigue,"There is growing evidence that driver fatigue is a major road safety problem, causing crashes that frequently involve fatalities and severe injuries. Professional drivers are among the road users indicated by literature to be at high risk of involvement in a fatigue-related crash. The goal of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of objective and subjective data collection and analysis in predicting driving behavior under fatigue. Toward this goal, the impact of a fatigue-training program addressing professional drivers was assessed through a naturalistic study on data collected by trip recorders (Geographical Positioning System devices). Analysis of these data was supplemented with the collection of self-reported data obtained through a questionnaire survey to investigate potential threats, deficiencies, and bias of the approaches. Findings revealed that there is some correlation between the two approaches measuring driving behavior under fatigue. Focusing on self-reported data, it was indicated that the training program affected positively the direction of change in the behavior of the professional drivers, addressed by an increase in the proportion of drivers who stop and rest when tired. The naturalistic approach and the testing of potential differences before and after the training program with reference to speed and average stop time showed that the training program encouraged drivers to reduce their speed and increase the time that they stop and rest.",10.1177/0361198119843099
"Azar, Joseph; Makhoul, Abdallah; Barhamgi, Mahmoud; Couturier, Raphael",An energy efficient IoT data compression approach for edge machine learning,"Many IoT systems generate a huge and varied amount of data that need to be processed and responded to in a very short time. One of the major challenges is the high energy consumption due to the transmission of data to the cloud. Edge computing allows the workload to be offloaded from the cloud at a location closer to the source of data that need to be processed while saving time, improving privacy, and reducing network traffic. In this paper, we propose an energy efficient approach for IoT data collection and analysis. First of all, we apply a fast error-bounded lossy compressor on the collected data prior to transmission, that is considered to be the greatest consumer of energy in an IoT device. In a second phase, we rebuild the transmitted data on an edge node and process it using supervised machine learning techniques. To validate our approach, we consider the context of driving behavior monitoring in intelligent vehicle systems where vital signs data are collected from the driver using a Wireless Body Sensor Network (WBSN) and wearable devices and sent to an edge node for stress level detection. The experimentation results show that the amount of transmitted data has been reduced by up to 103 times without affecting the quality of medical data and driver stress level prediction accuracy.

"Ding, Changhao; Liu, Mutian; Wang, Yi; Yan, Fuwu; Yan, Lirong",Behavior Evaluation Based on Electroencephalograph and Personality in a Simulated Driving Experiment,"Assessments and predictions of driving behavior are very important to improve traffic safety. We hypothesized that there were some patterns of driving behaviors, and these patterns had some correlation with cognitive states and personalities. To test this hypothesis, an evaluation of driving status, based on electroencephalography (EEG) and steering behavior in a simulated driving experiment, was designed and performed. Unity 3D was utilized to design the simulated driving scene. A photoelectric encoder fixed on the steering wheel and the corresponding data collection, transmission, and storage device was developed by Arduino, to acquire the rotation direction, angle, angular velocity, and angular acceleration of the steering wheel. Biopac MP 150 was utilized to collect the EEG data simultaneously during driving. A total of 23 subjects (mean age 23.6 +/- 1.3 years, driving years: 2.4 +/- 1.6 years, 21 males and two females) participated in this study. The Fuzzy C-means algorithm (FCMA) was utilized to extract patterns of driving behavior and the cognitive state within the window width of 20 s. The behaviors were divided into five kinds, i.e., negative, normal, alert, stress, and violent behavior, respectively, based on the standard deviation of steering wheel data. The cognitive states were divided into four kinds, i.e., negative, calm, alert, and tension, respectively, based on the EEG data. The correlation of these data, together with the personality traits evaluated using Cattell 16 Personality Factor Questionnaire (16PF) were analyzed using multiclass logistic regression. Results indicated the significance of the cognitive state and seven personality traits [apprehension (O), rule consciousness (G), reasoning (B), emotional stability (C), liveliness (F), vigilance (L), and perfectionism (Q3)] in predicting driving behaviors, and the prediction accuracy was 80.2%. The negative and alert cognitive states were highly correlated with dangerous driving, including negative and violent behaviors. Personality traits complicate the relationship with driving behaviors, which may vary across different types of subjects and traffic accidents.",10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01235
"Chen, Zhijun; Zhang, Yishi; Wu, Chaozhong; Ran, Bin",Understanding Individualization Driving States via Latent Dirichlet Allocation Model,"Automatic driving technology has become one of the hottest research topics of the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the recent years. The development of automatic driving technology can be promoted through understanding driving states of each driver (individualization driving). Although some methods for driving states understanding are proposed by previous studies, the latent driving states and structured driving behaviors has not yet been automatically discovered. The purpose of this study is to develop an unsupervised method for deeply understanding the individualization driving. First, an encode method is proposed to extracted driving behavior from vehicle motion data. Then, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model is innovatively developed to understand latent driving states and quantified structure of the driving behavior patterns (topics) from individualization driving (documents) using driving behaviors (words). In order to validate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method, twenty-two drivers (15 males and 7 females) were recruited to carry out road experiments in Wuhan, China for experiments data collection. In addition, two typical unsupervised methods, including k-means and the random method are established and their performances are compared in our experiments. Experimental results verify the superiority of proposed method compared with other methods.",10.1109/MITS.2019.2903525

Annually, about 1.25 million lives are lost, whereas 50 million suffer from road traffic injuries globally. It has been shown that over 60% of the reasons for traffic injuries are a risky driving behavior (RDB). Despite the problem's pervasiveness, there is a paucity of information about level and factors influencing RDB among professional car drivers in Bahirdar city, northwest Ethiopia.MethodsAn institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from February to March 2016. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select 376 participants. A self-administered driver behavior questionnaire (DBQ) was used for data collection. We performed a binary logistic regression analysis to investigate the associations of variables. Potential confounders were controlled using a multivariable logistic regression model. We ascertained the significance at <0.05 p value and evaluated strength of associations using crude odds ratios (COR) and adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).ResultsA total of 361 drivers participated (response rate, 96%). The mean age was 34 (standard deviations 7.97) years. The majority, 98.9% (N=357), were males. The level of risky driving behavior and road traffic crashes were 79.4% (95% CI 75.92, 83.97) and 16.3% (95% CI 15.91, 24.84), respectively. Average monthly salary [AOR 2.04; 95% CI (1.23, 2.74)], driving experience [AOR 2.72; 95% CI (1.07, 6.89)], distance driven per year [AOR 2.06; 95% CI (1.13, 4.10)], and previous history of involvement in traffic crashes [AOR 2.30; 95% CI (1.15, 7.35)] were significantly associated with risky driving behavior.Conclusions The study shows that risky driving behavior is common among professional car drivers in the study setting. Therefore, it is strongly advisable for policy makers and other stake holders to devise strategies that consider working conditions, like monthly salary and driving experiences. The study also suggests that it is often advisable to reduce the distance driven per year and learn from implications of previous history of involvement in traffic crashes.",10.1186/s12199-019-0772-1
"Hu, Xianbiao; Zhu, Xiaoyu; Ma, Yu-Luen; Chiu, Yi-Chang; Tang, Qing",Advancing usage-based insurance - a contextual driving risk modelling and analysis approach,"Most researchers and insurers evaluate driver's risks solely based on user global positioning system (GPS) trajectories. A new approach is proposed that collects individualised driving behaviour data from smartphone GPS module, combined with geographical network information and dynamic traffic conditions, to identify driving risk factors and evaluate driving behaviours in various contexts. The multi-source data reveals real world activity patterns as to when, where and how an individual driver performs, from which performance measurements on both the trip and driver level are defined to measure the risks. In addition, the relationship between the defined driving performance measurements and accident rate can be examined and verified by combining the crash history of the drivers. Numeric analysis on the trip level demonstrates that driving behaviour is context-sensitive, and the principal component analysis performed at the driver level shows that pedal operation and driving speed are the two most important performance measurements to characterise an individual's driving pattern. The subsequent correlation analysis of crash history and driving performances verify both pedal operation and driving speed are significantly related to more at-fault accidents, which validates the modelling and analysis efforts. The findings of their study further existing knowledge and provide foundations for advanced pay-as-you-drive-and-you-save insurance pricing.",10.1049/iet-its.2018.5194

A novel data-based method is presented for designing a Personalized Adaptive Cruise Control (PACC) system in this paper. First, a driving-data-acquisition platform is established, and a large amount of real-world driving data from 84 human drivers is collected. To measure the similarity of human drivers quantitatively, the driving data of every driver are regarded as a specific distribution of some features, fitted with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is introduced as the driving similarity index. After that, an unsupervised clustering algorithm is realized in this paper, and these drivers are grouped into three separate groups. A practical PACC structure is designed in the second stage based on the grouped driving data to include different driving characteristics, mainly in three aspects: speed control, distance control, and the switching rule. Then real-vehicle experiments are carried out. Results demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed PACC algorithm to reflect different driving styles.",10.1016/j.trc.2019.01.025
"Dhahir, Bashar; Hassan, Yasser",Using horizontal curve speed reduction extracted from the naturalistic driving study to predict curve collision frequency,"Many models have been developed to predict collision frequency and evaluate safety performance on horizontal curves. The approach used in data collection or some assumptions made in the analysis methodology might lead to inaccurate results. For example, manual data collection, equipment limitations, and field experiments involving monitoring driving behavior for a specific region for a short-term are potential sources of errors in data collection. This paper aims at overcoming some of these issues in developing models to evaluate safety performance of horizontal curves and predict the curve collision frequency. The developed models relate expected collision frequency on horizontal curves to the speed reduction from the approach tangent to the curve, which is commonly used as a major geometric design consistency measure. The methodology to achieve this objective included three tasks; data collection, evaluating and modeling the viable speed reduction parameters, and developing safety performance models to estimate collision frequency on horizontal curves. Individual drivers' trips on 49 horizontal curves on rural two-lane highways in rolling and mountainous terrains in Washington State were extracted from the Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) database. Models were developed to relate different speed reduction parameters to curve characteristics. These models were then applied to 1430 horizontal curves in Washington State to estimate the speed reduction parameters and relate them to collision frequency. Several safety performance models were developed which show that speed reduction, as a design consistency measure, is directly related to collision frequency on horizontal curves. Furthermore, the speed reduction parameters are more significant variables in predicting collision frequency than all curve geometric parameters.",10.1016/j.aap.2018.11.020

In that regard, information and communication technologies have been used to understand adolescent driving behavior and develop interventions. Objective: The purpose of this review is to explore and discuss existing approaches to technology-based driving interventions, driving assessments, and solutions in the literature. Methods: We searched the Web of Science and PubMed databases following a review protocol to collect relevant peer-reviewed journal articles. Inclusion criteria were (1) being published in the English language, (2) being published in a peer-reviewed journal, (3) testing the driving behavior of teens with technology-based intervention methods, and (4) being published between January 2000 and March 2018. We appraised the articles by reading their abstracts to select studies matching the inclusion criteria and reading the full text of articles for final refinement. Results: Initial keyword searches on technology-based solutions resulted in 828 publications that we refined further by title screening (n=131) and abstract evaluation against inclusion criteria (n=29). Finally, we selected 16 articles that met the inclusion criteria and examined them regarding the use of technology-based interventions, assessments, and solutions. Use of built-in tracking devices and installation of black box devices were widely used methods for capturing driving events. Smartphones were increasingly adapted for data collection, and use of gamification for intervention design was an emerging concept. Visual and audio feedback also were used for intervention. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that social influence is effective in technology-based interventions; parental involvement for promoting safe driving behavior is highly effective. However, the use of smartphones and gamification needs more study regarding their implementation and sustainability.

"Dong, Chiyu; Chen, Yilun; Dolan, John M.",Interactive Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving via Recurrent Meta Induction Neural Network,"Interactive driving is challenging but essential for autonomous cars in dense traffic or urban areas. Proper interaction requires understanding and prediction of future trajectories of all neighboring cars around a target vehicle. Current solutions typically assume a certain distribution or stochastic process to approximate human-driven cars' behaviors. To relax this assumption, a Recurrent Meta Induction Network (RMIN) framework is developed. The original Conditional Neural Process (CNP) on which this is based does not consider the sequence of the conditions, due to the permutation invariance requirements for stochastic processes. However, the sequential information is important for the driving behavior estimation. Therefore, in the proposed method, a recurrent neural cell replaces the original demonstration sub-net. The behavior estimation is conditioned on the historical observations for all related cars, including the target car and its surrounding cars. The method is applied to predict the lane change trajectory of a target car in dense traffic areas. The proposed method achieves better results than previous methods and thanks to the meta-learning framework, it can use a smaller dataset, putting fewer demands on autonomous driving data collection.",

"Qi, Geqi; Wu, Jianping; Zhou, Yang; Du, Yiman; Jia, Yuhan; Hounsell, Nick; Stanton, Neville A.",Recognizing driving styles based on topic models,"With the explosion of information in our current era, senders of information increasingly need to target their messages to recipients. However, messages within transportation systems, including traffic information and commercial advertisements, tend to be transmitted to all drivers indiscriminately. This is because the information providers (such as other vehicles, roads, facilities, buildings etc.), can hardly recognize the variations within drivers, who should be treated differently as information recipients. As a result of the rapid development of data collection technologies and machine learning techniques in recent years, extraction and recognition of drivers' unique driving style from actual driving behaviour data become possible. In this paper, two kinds of topic models are investigated: mLDA and mHLDA, to discover distinguishable driving style information with hidden structure from the real-world driving behaviour data. The results show that the proposed models can successfully recognize the differences between driving styles. The study is of great value for providing deep insight into the underlying structure of driving styles and can effectively support the recognition of drivers with different driving styles.",10.1016/j.trd.2018.05.002

The driving data are collected by a 3-axis accelerometer, which records the lateral, longitudinal and vertical accelerations. In this research, a data transformation way is developed to extract interpretable statistics features from raw 3-axis sensor data and utilise machine learning algorithms to identify drivers. To eliminate the bias caused by the sensor installation and ensure the applicability of their approach, they present a data calibration method which proves to be necessary for a comparative test. Four basic supervised classification algorithms are used to perform on the data set for comparison. To improve classification performance, they propose a multiple classifier system, which combines the outputs of several classifiers. Experimental results based on real-world data show that the proposed algorithm is effective on solving driver identification problem. Among the four basic algorithms, random forests (RFs) algorithm has the greatest performance on accuracy, recall and precision. With the proposed multiple classifier system, a greater performance can be achieved in small number of drivers' groups. RFs algorithm takes the lead in running speed.

Our motivation is to improve driver experience using preview information from navigation maps. Smartphones facilitate, due to their unprecedented market penetration, the large-scale deployment of advanced driver assistance systems. On the other hand, it is challenging to exploit smartphone sensor data because of the fewer and lower quality signals, compared to the ones on board. Methods for detecting braking behavior using smartphones exist, however, most of them focus only on harsh events. Additionally, only a few studies correlate longitudinal driving behavior with the road condition. In this paper, a new method, based on deep neural networks and the sliding correlation coefficient, is proposed for the spatio-temporal correlation of road anomalies and driver behavior. A unique deep neural network structure, that requires minimum tuning, is proposed. Extensive field trials were conducted and vehicle motion was recorded using smartphones and a data acquisition system, comprising an inertial measurement unit and differential GPS.

The method proves to be a robust and flexible tool for self-learning driver behavior.",10.1109/TITS.2018.2797943
"Dhahir, Bashar; Hassan, Yasser",Studying Driving Behavior on Horizontal Curves using Naturalistic Driving Study Data,"Many studies have been conducted to develop models to predict speed and driver comfort thresholds on horizontal curves, and to evaluate design consistency. The approaches used to develop these models differ from one another in data collection, data processing, assumptions, and analysis. However, some issues might be associated with the data collection that can affect the reliability of collected data and developed models. In addition, analysis of speed behavior on the assumption that vehicles traverse horizontal curves at a constant speed is far from actual driving behavior. Using the Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) database can help overcome problems associated with data collection. This paper aimed at using NDS data to investigate driving behavior on horizontal curves in terms of speed, longitudinal acceleration, and comfort threshold. The NDS data were valuable in providing clear insight on drivers' behavior during daytime and favorable weather conditions. A methodology was developed to evaluate driver behavior and was coded in Matlab. Sensitivity analysis was performed to recommend values for the parameters that can affect the output. Analysis of the drivers' speed behavior and comfort threshold highlighted several issues that describe how drivers traverse horizontal curves that need to be considered in horizontal curve design and consistency evaluation.",10.1177/0361198118784384
"Raju, Narayana; Kumar, Pallav; Jain, Aayush; Arkatkar, Shriniwas S.; Joshi, Gaurang",Application of Trajectory Data for Investigating Vehicle Behavior in Mixed Traffic Environment,"The research work reported here investigates driving behavior under mixed traffic conditions on high-speed, multilane highways. With the involvement of multiple vehicle classes, high-resolution trajectory data is necessary for exploring vehicle-ollowing, lateral movement, and seeping behavior under varying traffic flow states. An access-controlled, mid-block road section was selected for video data collection under varying traffic flow conditions. Using a semi-automated image processing tool, vehicular trajectory data was developed for three different traffic states. Micro-level behavior such as lateral placement of vehicles as a function of speed, instant responses, vehicle-following behavior, and hysteresis phenomenon were evaluated under different traffic flow states. It was found that lane-wise behavior degraded with increase in traffic volume and vehicles showed a propensity to move towards the median at low flow and towards the curb-side at moderate and heavy flows. Further, vehicle-following behavior was also investigated and it was found that with increase in flow level, vehicles are more inclined to mimic the leader vehicle's behavior. In addition to following time, perceiving time of subject vehicle for different leading vehicles was also evaluated for different vehicle classes. From the analysis, it was inferred that smaller vehicles are switching their leader vehicles more often to escape from delay, resulting in less following and perceiving time and aggressive gap acceptance. The present research work reveals the need for high-quality, micro-level data for calibrating driving behavior models under mixed traffic conditions.",10.1177/0361198118787364
"Gershon, Pnina; Ehsani, Johnathon P.; Zhu, Chunming; Sita, Kellienne R.; Klauer, Sheila; Dingus, Tom; Simons-Morton, Bruce",Crash Risk and Risky Driving Behavior Among Adolescents During Learner and Independent Driving Periods,"Purpose: Novice adolescents' crash rates are highly elevated early in licensure, despite substantial practice driving during the learner period. The objectives of this study were to examine the variability in measures of driving risk among adolescents during the learner and early independent driving periods and evaluate how risk varies by driving experience, gender, time of day, and road surface conditions. Methods: Objective driving data were collected in a naturalistic cohort study of 90 adolescent drivers with learner driving permit and 131 experienced adult drivers. Participants' private vehicles were equipped with data acquisition system documenting driving kinematics, miles driven, and video recordings of the driver and the driving environment. Crash/near-crash (CNC) and kinematic risky driving (KRD) rates were calculated during the learner and early independent driving periods by gender (female/male), time of day (day/night), and road surface conditions (wet/dry) for adolescents and adults. Results: CNC and KRD rates of adolescents were similar to adult drivers during the learner period (CNC: incident rate ratio [IRR] = 1.67, confidence interval [CI] = .98-2.82 and KRD: IRR = 1.04, CI = .78-1.40, respectively), but dramatically higher in the first year of independent driving (CNC: IRR = 6.51, CI = 4.03-10.51 and KRD: IRR = 3.95, CI = 2.96-5.26, respectively), and particularly elevated the first 3 months of licensure. Adolescent KRD rates were higher for males than females and invariably higher than adult rates during day and night, wet and dry conditions. Conclusions: While the learner driving period was relatively safe for adolescents, the transition to independent driving was typified by a dramatic increase in risk among adolescents that was higher than adult rates overall and under varying driving conditions.

"Gershon, Pnina; Ehsani, Johnathon; Zhu, Chunming; O'Brien, Fearghal; Klauer, Sheila; Dingus, Tom; Simons-Morton, Bruce",Vehicle ownership and other predictors of teenagers risky driving behavior: Evidence from a naturalistic driving study,"Objective: Risky driving behavior may contribute to the high crash risk among teenage drivers. The current naturalistic driving study assessed predictors for teenagers' kinematic risky driving (KRD) behavior and the interdependencies between them. Method: The private vehicles of 81 novice teenage drivers were equipped with data acquisition system that recorded driving kinematics, miles driven, and video recordings of the driver, passengers and the driving environment. Psychosocial measures were collected using questionnaires administered at licensure. Poisson regression analyses and model selection were used to assess factors associated with teens' risky driving behavior and the interactions between them. Results: Driving own vs shared vehicle, driving during the day vs at night, and driving alone vs with passengers were significantly associated with higher KRD rates (Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of 1.60, 1.41, and 1.28, respectively). Teenagers reporting higher vs lower levels of parental trust had significantly lower KRD rates (IRR = 0.58). KRD rates were 88% higher among teenagers driving with a passenger in their own vehicle compared to teenagers driving with a passenger in a shared vehicle. Similarly, KRD rates during the day were 74% higher among teenagers driving their own vehicle compared to those driving a shared vehicle. Conclusions: Novice teenagers' risky driving behavior varied according to driver attributes and contextual aspects of the driving environment. As such, examining teenagers' risky driving behavior should take into account multiple contributing factors and their interactions. The variability in risky driving according to the driving context can inform the development of targeted interventions to reduce the crash risk of novice teenage drivers.",10.1016/j.aap.2018.06.001
"Kamaluddin, Noor Azreena; Andersen, Camilla Sloth; Larsen, Mette Kathrine; Meltofte, Katrine Rabjerg; Varhelyi, Andras",Self-reporting traffic crashes - a systematic literature review,"Purpose: A traffic safety analysis that is based on registered crashes often suffers from underreporting, which may result in biased conclusions and lead to misguided crash-prevention strategies. Self-reporting traffic crashes is a complementary method to obtain crash information that is often not available in official databases. By surveying studies from around the world, this paper aims to map the current practices in the collection of data from self-reporting traffic crashes. Method: A systematic literature search was carried out in three databases, ScienceDirect, Scopus and Transport Research International Documentation (TRID), resulting in 134 reviewed studies. Results: Self-reported crash studies were found to be more common in Europe, North America and Australasia, but there are few studies in developing countries. The reviewed studies mostly focused on adult road users (i.e. legal age of obtaining driving license and with no upper limit) and car users. Questionnaires (either paper based or online) were the most often used method, and 1 year was the most common recall period used. Regardless of its drawbacks, the reviewed studies showed that researchers 'trust' self-reports. Conclusion: More studies should be conducted, especially targeting adolescent and young adults (age of 15-30 years) and vulnerable road users (VRUs). Developing countries should increase their efforts when it comes to using self-reporting to better assess the actual traffic safety situation and produce knowledge-based appropriate safety measures. Utilisation of smartphone application to assist data collection in self-reporting study for in-depth crash analysis should be explored further.",10.1186/s12544-018-0301-0

However, this research is limited by several factors: the cost of equipment installation; management and storage of the large amounts of data collected; and data reduction, coding, and analyses. Modern smartphone technology includes accelerometers built into phones, and the vast, global proliferation of smartphones could provide a possible low-cost alternative for assessing kinematic risky driving. Objective: We evaluated an in-house developed iPhone app (gForce) for detecting elevated g-force events by comparing the iPhone linear acceleration measurements with corresponding acceleration measurements obtained with both a custom Android app and the in-vehicle miniDAS data acquisition system (DAS; Virginia Tech Transportation Institute). Methods: The iPhone and Android devices were dashboard-mounted in a vehicle equipped with the DAS instrumentation. The experimental protocol consisted of driving maneuvers on a test track, such as cornering, braking, and turning that were performed at different acceleration levels (ie, mild, moderate, or hard). The iPhone gForce app recorded linear acceleration (ie, gravity-corrected). The Android app recorded gravity-corrected and uncorrected acceleration measurements, and the DAS device recorded gravity-uncorrected acceleration measurements. Lateral and longitudinal acceleration measures were compared. Results: The correlation coefficients between the iPhone and DAS acceleration measurements were slightly lower compared to the correlation coefficients between the Android and DAS, possibly due to the gravity correction on the iPhone. Averaging the correlation coefficients for all maneuvers, the longitudinal and lateral acceleration measurements between iPhone and DAS were r(lng) =0.71 and r(lat) =0.83, respectively, while the corresponding acceleration measurements between Android and DAS were r(lng) =0.95 and r(lat) =0.97. The correlation coefficients between lateral accelerations on all three devices were higher than with the corresponding longitudinal accelerations for most maneuvers. Conclusions: The gForce iPhone app reliably assessed elevated g-force events compared to the DAS. Collectively, the gForce app and iPhone platform have the potential to serve as feature-rich, inexpensive, scalable, and open-source tool for assessment of kinematic risky driving events, with potential for research and feedback forms of intervention.",10.2196/mhealth.9290

However, the research of driving behavior classifying method is still not perfect due to lack of a quantitative analysis tool to divide the driving behavior of different drivers into diverse levels of safety. This paper presents a driving-data-driven platform of driving behavior spectrum for vehicle networks. The proposed platform works in four stages. First, the evaluation indexes and the characteristic indexes of the driving behavior spectrum are defined. Second, the improved k-means algorithm is used to analyze the driving styles, and the driving skills were analyzed using the regression learning. Then, the basic driving data acquisition scheme of the driving behavior spectrum built on vehicle networks is designed, and the data preprocessing method is proposed. Finally, an analysis tool is developed. The presented platform can significantly improve the driving behavior research and provide references for management departments to formulate strategies for improving traffic safety.<bold> </bold>",10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2018.00099
